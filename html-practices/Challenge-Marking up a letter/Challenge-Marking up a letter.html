        <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
        <p>
          Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of
          Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your
          <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> (Doctor of Philosophy)

        </p>
        <section id="question_1">
          <h2>Starting dates</h2>
          <p id="answer_1">
            We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any
            time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the
            beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as
            follows:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>

          </ul>
          <p>
            Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you

          <h2>Subject of study</h2>
          <p id="answer_1">
            At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded
            research facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the
            realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent,
            dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have
            on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most
            intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of
                Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at
                temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size
                exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 103 increasing to 3 ×
                10<sup>4</sup>.)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, Hypertext
                Markup Language, and
                <abbr
                  title="Cascading Style
                Sheets"
                  >CSS</abbr
                >, Cascading Style Sheets, constructs for representing musical
                scores.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            So please can you provide more information on each of these
            subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take,
            required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd
            need to know? Thanks.
          </p>

          <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
          <p id="answer_1">
            Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I
            <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my
            favorite dances are as follows, with definitions:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
            <dd>
              A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back as
              far as 300 <abbr title="Before Common Era">BCE</abbr>, a whole
              village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage
              their livestock to be "fruitful".
            </dd>
            <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
            <dd>
              Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm,
              they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close
              together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies
              around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my
              fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired
              modern styles such as Twerking.
            </dd>
            <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
            <dd>
              An interesting example of historic misinformation, English
              explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance
              style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being
              practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on
              however it was discovered that they were just moving like this
              because they were really cold.
